At least what's in it is good quality. Mics work great, the speakers distort at higher volumes (they are a bit overdriven).\n- The room itself (VIP room) had some weird smell, maybe coming from the AC unit or the couches, floor. It would need some deeper cleaning after a big party.\n- Toilet was missing the seat. I hope I don't need to explain this one...\nOverall, we had a great time, but there is room for improvement.",

The sound of the microphone is too small and there is no echo. If you use the karaoke system, there are almost no Korean songs and they come out with English subtitles, and when you play the songs through YouTube, the sound is so loud that you can barely hear your voice through the microphone, so there's no point in singing in a karaoke. It seems that they operate the karaoke in a place that doesn't have proper soundproofing, so the microphone sound is limited. If you go here thinking of a Korean karaoke, you'll be very disappointed. I just went because it was cheap, but I wasted 20,000 won on taxi fare and 1-hour usage fee. But the staff were friendly. I was just disappointed because the environment was different, but the staff worked hard.",
